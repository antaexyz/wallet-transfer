# Wallet Transfer

I found it very annoying to send all my tokens one by one to my new wallet address, so I made this app.<br>
It's compatible with Ethereum, Polygon, BSC and Gnosis and only supports erc20 tokens for the moment.

## Getting started:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/antaexyz/wallet-transfer.git
cd wallet-transfer
yarn install && yarn --cwd ./functions install
```


## Usage: 

1 - Get a free api key on the [covalent](https://www.covalenthq.com/) website 

2 - Rename the **.env.example** file to **.env** and add your api key

3 - Start the server with `yarn nd`
