<h1>Wallet Transfert</h1>
<h2>Transfer all your tokens from a wallet to another in a few clicks.</h2>
<p>
	I found it very annoying to send all my tokens one by one to my new wallet
	address, so I made this app. <br /> It's compatible with Ethereum, Polygon, and
	Gnosis and only supports erc20 tokens for the moment.
